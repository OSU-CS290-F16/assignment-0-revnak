<h1>Hello</h1>
<h2>Assignment 0</h2>
<p>
I did not have much trouble with this assignment. I have used the website and the gui for github before, so I just used the webtools for uploading everything.
</p>
<p>
I did not learn much from this assignment, though I did get a bit more familiar with github.
</p>
<p>
I found the two guides for github you posted useful for re-aquainting myself with github.

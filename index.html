<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
My name is Joshua Novak. I prefer to be called Novak or Joshua.
</p>
<p>
I am an applied computer science major and I am essentially a Junior. I had to take a year and a half off for financial reasons, so I'm not particularly certain how far along I am.

I would put my HTML experience at around a 6/10. I took the Databases class that was the old pro-school pre-req, and I took numerous HTML classes in High School and earlier. I do not think that I could create a professional page, but I do feel confident enough in my abilities with HTML that I think I should be able to make it through this class rather easily.
</p>
<p>
I hope to learn enough HTML to be able to try my hand at professional web development, though as I understand it this course will not be taking us that far.

I have signed up for Piazza

My friend nearly cut another friend's hand off with a sword while I was there. I mean, I wasn't actually there, I was just playing Alpha Protocol inside while they were wounding each other like a couple of idiots. My dumb friends proceeded to try and clean up the bleeding sword wound with a bundle of paper towels and had no idea how to open the wounded party's cell phone so that they could call his grandmother. Eventually they figured it out and the near-maimed friend got to confuse some nurses when he explained that he had been wounded in a sword fight.
<br>
Alpha Protocol is a great game by the way. 10/10.
